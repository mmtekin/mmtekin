# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm **Malik**, a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan (graduating Winter 2026) who loves learning new things and building cool stuff.  

- ðŸŒ± **What Iâ€™m learning:**  
  - **Go**: Trying to wrap my head around its concurrency and why everyone loves it for distributed systems.  
  - **Next.js**: Because who doesnâ€™t love making modern, interactive websites without needing a separate backend?  

- ðŸ’» **Check out my Portfolio:**  
  Itâ€™s got some of my favorite projects and a bit about me: [malikportfolio.vercel.app](https://malikportfolio.vercel.app/)  

- ðŸ“¬ **Reach me here:**  
  Shoot me an email at [mmtekin@umich.edu](mailto:mmtekin@umich.edu). Iâ€™m always up for a chat or collaboration!  

- âš¡ **Fun Fact:**  
  I lived in Turkey for five years, and it definitely shaped who I am today. Plus, Iâ€™ll never say no to some Turkish tea.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to poke around, and letâ€™s make something awesome together. ðŸš€
